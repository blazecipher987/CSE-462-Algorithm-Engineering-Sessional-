Here are the steps for the Christofides algorithm. Kindly follow them and give me a python code.

1. Finding MST using Kruskal's Algorithm
2. Finding an Eulerian circuit which requires the use of Handshaking lemma to create a subgraph from the MST
3. Find the minimum cost perfect matching paris using Blossom Algorithm
4. Combine MST and Pairs to find an Eulerian tour
5. Remove the duplicates which are known as "Shortcutting" by validating using triangle inequality property (AB + BC >= AC)

Result: Final tour

Report relevant graphs for this (MST, Subgraph, Final graph) and the final cost
